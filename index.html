        <h1>Clinical relevance</h1>
        <p>
            In addition to contributing to our understanding of pre-eclampsia, our findings might influence the information women are given about the risk of pre-eclampsia in a subsequent pregnancy by providing risk estimates stratified by history...

        <h1>ABSTRACT</h1>

        <h2>Objective</h2>
        <p>To investigate whether pre-eclampsia is more common in first pregnancies solely because fewer affected women, who presumably have a higher risk of recurrence, go on to have subsequent pregnancies.</p>

        <h2>Design</h2>
        <p>Prospective cohort study.</p>

        <h2>Setting</h2>
        <p>Swedish Medical Birth Register.</p>

        <h2>Participants</h2>
        <p>763,795 primiparous mothers who had their first births in Sweden, 1987-2004.</p>

        <h2>Main outcome measures</h2>
        <p>Pre-eclampsia.</p>

        <h2>Results</h2>
        <p>The risk of pre-eclampsia was 4.1% in the first pregnancy and 1.7% in later pregnancies overall. However, the risk was 14.7% in the second pregnancy for women who had had pre-eclampsia in their first pregnancy and 31.9% for women who had had pre-eclampsia in the previous two pregnancies...</p>

        <h2>Conclusions</h2>
        <p>Having pre-eclampsia in one pregnancy is a poor predictor of subsequent pregnancy but a strong predictor for recurrence of pre-eclampsia in future gestations...</p>

    <h1>METHODS</h1>

    <h2>Study population</h2>
    <p>The Swedish Medical Birth Register is a population based registry that includes more than 98% of all births in Sweden.<sup>6</sup> Starting with the first antenatal visit, normally at 8-12 weeks’ gestation, information is prospectively collected on maternal demographic data, reproductive history, pregnancy, and birth characteristics. Such information is recorded on the standardised antenatal, obstetric, and neonatal records, and copies of these records are forwarded to the birth register, where the information is computerised.</p>

<section>
    <h2>Outcome Definition and Ascertainment</h2>
    <p>The diagnoses are noted by a doctor at the time of discharge from the hospital, using ICD-9 and ICD-10 (international classification of diseases, 9th and 10th revisions). Pre-eclampsia is defined as a diastolic blood pressure of at least 90 mm Hg accompanied by proteinuria (≥0.3 g/day or ≥1 on a urine dipstick) (ICD-9 codes 642 E-F and ICD-10 code O14). Eclampsia is defined as the occurrence of pre-eclampsia with seizures (ICD-9 code 642 G and ICD-10 code O15). We included pre-eclamptic and eclamptic pregnancies in our analysis. The quality of the diagnosis of pre-eclampsia has previously been validated: of 148 pregnancies coded as pre-eclampsia in the birth register, 137 (93%) had pre-eclampsia according to the individual records.<sup>7</sup> Early and late onset pre-eclampsia have different heritability, risk factors, clinical manifestations, and prognosis.<sup>8-13</sup> As information on timing of onset was not available through the register, we used preterm delivery as a proxy for early onset and severity. Pre-eclampsia was considered “severe” when delivery occurred before 34 completed gestational weeks.</p>

    <h2>Key Takeaways</h2>
    <h3>What is already known on this topic</h3>
    <p>The risk of pre-eclampsia is higher in first pregnancies (4.1%) than in subsequent ones (1.7%).</p>

    <h3>What this study adds</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>The lower overall risk of pre-eclampsia among parous women is not explained by fewer pregnancies among women who experienced pre-eclampsia in a previous gestation.</li>
        <li>The risk of recurrence is around 15% for women who had pre-eclampsia in one previous pregnancy and around 30% when two consecutive previous pregnancies were affected.</li>
        <li>Recurrence is higher for pre-eclampsias associated with very preterm delivery.</li>
    </ul>
